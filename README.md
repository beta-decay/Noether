# Noether
Named after the mathematician Emmy Noether, Noether is a revse polish notation, stack-based programming language with similarities to the Fourier programming language. In particular, Noether was designed to be a more functional and more useful version of Fourier.

## Built-in Functions

These are the functions which exist in Noether. They are subject to change without prior notice.

### Single argument functions

### Double argument functions

All of these functions pop the top two items off the stack

***+***
 - **Number and a Number:** adds the two  numbers and pushes the result
 - **String and a Number:** converts the number to a string, concatenates it to the string and pushes the result
 - **String and a String:** concatenates the strings and pushes the result
 
 ***-***
 
 - **Number and a Number:** subtracts the two  numbers and pushes the result
